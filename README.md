# Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Titanic Dataset ðŸš¢

##  Objective
To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand the data distribution, discover patterns, identify anomalies, and find relationships between features and survival rate.

---

##  Dataset
**Source:** [Kaggle - Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

---

##  Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly

---

##  Key EDA Tasks Completed

1. **Summary Statistics**
   - Described dataset with `.describe()` and `.info()`
   - Identified data types and missing values

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Checked for nulls in `Age`, `Cabin`, `Embarked`, etc.
   - Categorical encoding preparation (if needed for modeling)

3. **Univariate Analysis**
   - Histograms & boxplots for numerical features like `Age`, `Fare`
   - Countplots for categorical features like `Sex`, `Pclass`, `Embarked`

4. **Bivariate Analysis**
   - Correlation matrix (heatmap) for numerical features
   - Pairplots (Seaborn) to examine feature relationships

5. **Interactive Visuals**
   - Plotly scatter matrix to explore relationships dynamically

6. **Key Inferences**
   - Higher survival rate in **1st class passengers**
   - **Women and children** had higher survival rates
   - Passengers embarking from **Cherbourg (C)** had better survival odds
   - `Fare` and `Age` distributions showed outliers and skewness

## âœ… Next Steps
- Imputation of missing values (e.g., age using median)
- Feature engineering (e.g., family size, title extraction from name)
- Move to predictive modeling (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
